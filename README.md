# 2023 Year in Review

Built with
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Framer Motion

Bootstrapped with template `bunx create-vite my-app --template react-ts`

## Inspirations

It seems like all platforms are doing some year wrap up of their own (e.g. Spotify's Wrapped, Duolingo), why not make one that is actually about my life?
